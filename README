This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1889

the script is actually a perl script
and you only have to make a minor modification to vimrc
to be able to use it.
what it does it is automated to go to rafb.net
paste the current file you're editing there,and
then as rafb.net gives you a link to the file
the script will put it in your clipboard so you can reffer
to where you need it.
this script would be recommended for whoever needs to paste some code.
you can use F5 to run the script on the current file.
it only works on windows.
